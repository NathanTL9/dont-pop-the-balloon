CPSC 581 Project by Nathan Lum, Victor Dong, Parker Smith, Michaela Gilchrist

A project which focused on a "button" as the main function

Don’t Pop the Balloon is an interactive game where players can pass around a phone and physically pump it up and down. 
Our ‘button’ is this physical pumping motion. 
The balloon keeps a house afloat in a digital sky and it continues gaining elevation until a certain amount of air is pumped and the balloon bursts.
